These files contain the edge lists for the gold standard networks. To keep files sizes small, the files do NOT contain the complete list of non-edges. To indicate this fact, the files are named _Edges_ (instead of _GoldStandard_). The non-edges can easily be enumerated as the list of all possible node pairs that are absent from the edge list, excluding self-edges. The evaluation scripts perform this enumeration.
